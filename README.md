## 📌 Project Overview
Pneumonia is a lung infection that can be life-threatening if not diagnosed early. This project leverages **deep learning** to classify chest X-rays into:
- **Normal**
- **Pneumonia**

The model is trained on publicly available dataset ([Chest X-Ray Images (Pneumonia)](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/paultimothymooney/chest-xray-pneumonia)).
